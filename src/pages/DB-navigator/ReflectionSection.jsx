                This project reinforced that in enterprise travel apps, reducing cognitive load matters more than adding features. By addressing core uncertainties (support access, seat visibility, meal planning), we improved completion rates without increasing UI complexity. Future iterations will integrate real-time DB APIs and explore a WearOS companion for hands-free journey updates.
